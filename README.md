# Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-learning

Project Description: Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this project, we'll build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. We'll use Python along with the pandas library for data manipulation and the scikit-learn library to implement logistic regression for classification. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of 95% or higher in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Steps involved:

1. Data Collection: We'll start by obtaining a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, including features such as transaction amount, time, and various other attributes.

2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data may contain missing values or require normalization. We'll preprocess the data using pandas to handle missing values and scale the features if necessary.

3.Feature Selection/Engineering: Depending on the dataset, we may need to select relevant features or engineer new ones to improve the model's performance.

4.Model Training: We'll split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn. Then, we'll train a logistic regression model on the training data.

5.Model Evaluation: After training the model, we'll evaluate its performance on the test set using accuracy as the metric. Additionally, we may use other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.


6.Result Interpretation: Finally, we'll interpret the results and provide insights into the model's performance. We'll discuss the accuracy achieved and any potential areas for improvement.
